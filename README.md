## Use case 1: Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada <a id="usecase1"></a> 

### Short description 
The first use case is located in West Canada, in a basin called Fraser. The Fraser River rises at Fraser Pass near Blackrock Mountain in the Rocky Mountains and discharges into the Pacific Ocean at the city of Vancouver. With its 1,375 km length, it is the longest river within British Columbia and the 11^th longest river in Canada. The basin size is about 220,000 km^2, while the annual discharge at its mouth is 3,550 m^3/s.

For testing the LISFLOOD code we prepared all the required maps for a subsection of the Fraser basin (see red dashed box in Figure above). The maps cover the river section from the Nechako tributary in the North till the Quesnel tributary in the South. The outlet point of our test case is located on the main Fraser river at the hight of the Quesnel city and has an upstream area of 114,00 km^2. As our subsection covers only a relatively small portion of the catchment of the maps outlet, four inlet points have been implemented (called Shelley, Isle Pierre, near Cinema and near Quesnel) accounting for the discharge (of the Upper Fraser, Nechako, Blackwater and Quesnel river respectively) prior to "inflowing" into our map area.
